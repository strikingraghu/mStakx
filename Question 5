5 >> Install and configure Helm in Kubernetes

Solution -

First we'll install the helm command-line utility on our local machine.
Helm provides a script that handles the installation process on MacOS, Windows, or Linux.

cd /tmp
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > install-helm.sh


Make the script executable with chmod:
chmod u+x install-helm.sh


At this point we can use our favorite text editor to open the script and inspect it to make sure itâ€™s safe.
./install-helm.sh

We may be prompted for our password. Provide it and press ENTER.

Output
helm installed into /usr/local/bin/helm
Run 'helm init' to configure helm.






Tiller is a companion to the helm command that runs on your cluster, receiving commands from helm and communicating directly with the Kubernetes API to do the actual work of creating and deleting resources.

Create the tiller serviceaccount:
kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount tiller


Next, bind the tiller serviceaccount to the cluster-admin role:
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller


Now we can run helm init, which installs Tiller on our cluster, along with some local housekeeping tasks such as downloading the stable repo details:
helm init --service-account tiller


To verify that Tiller is running, list the pods in thekube-system namespace:
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
Output
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
. . .
kube-dns-64f766c69c-rm9tz               3/3       Running   0          22m
kube-proxy-worker-5884                  1/1       Running   1          21m
kube-proxy-worker-5885                  1/1       Running   1          21m
kubernetes-dashboard-7dd4fc69c8-c4gwk   1/1       Running   0          22m
tiller-deploy-5c688d5f9b-lccsk          1/1       Running   0          40s

Now that we've installed both Helm components, we're ready to use helm to install our first application.







Helm software packages are called charts. Helm comes preconfigured with a curated chart repository called stable. We can browse the available charts in their GitHub repo. We are going to install the Kubernetes Dashboard as an example.

Use helm to install the kubernetes-dashboard package from the stable repo:
helm install stable/kubernetes-dashboard --name dashboard-demo

Output
NAME:   dashboard-demo
