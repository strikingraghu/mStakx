USING IT WITH CIRCLECI
Linting, without trying to operate the chart, is easy to incorporate into a workflow. The following is a simple example CircleCI configuration to do so:


version: 2
jobs:
  lint-charts:
    docker:
      - image: quay.io/helmpack/chart-testing:v1.1.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: lint
          command: |
            chart_test.sh --config .testenv --no-install
workflows:
  version: 2
  lint:
    jobs:
      - lint-charts



In this case the environment variables for the configuration are stored in a file name .testenv. 
This file holds the environment variables and is sourced into the environment. 
The following is an example from the community charts:

# The name of the Git remote
REMOTE=k8s
# The name of the Git target branch
TARGET_BRANCH=master
# Chart directories separated by a space
CHART_DIRS=(
    stable
    incubator
)
# Charts that should be skipped
EXCLUDED_CHARTS=(
    common
)
# Additional chart repos to add (<name>=<url>), separated by a space
CHART_REPOS=(
    incubator=https://kubernetes-charts-incubator.storage.googleapis.com/
)
TIMEOUT=600
