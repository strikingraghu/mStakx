1 >> Create a Highly available Kubernetes cluster manually using Google Compute Engines (GCE). Do not create a Kubernetes hosted solution using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Use Kubeadm(preferred)/kubespray.
Do not use kops.



Prerequisites

Install gcloud as necessary. gcloud can be installed as a part of the Google Cloud SDK
(https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)

We need to have credentials for GCloud by running gcloud command
Command - gcloud auth login

One more thing, we can spin up a GCE VM from the command line.
Command - gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] \
--subnet [SUBNET_NAME] \
--zone [ZONE_NAME] \
--image-family [IMAGE_FAMILY] \
--image-project [IMAGE_PROJECT] \
--create-disk image=[DISK_IMAGE],image-project=[DISK_IMAGE_PROJECT],size=[SIZE_GB],type=[DISK_TYPE]


Starting a cluster

curl -sS https://get.k8s.io | bash
By default, some containers will already be running on cluster. Containers like fluentd provide logging, while heapster provides monitoring services.
If required, we can run more than one cluster in our project, or want to use a different name, or want a different number of worker nodes, then <kubernetes>/cluster/gce/config-default.sh file for more fine-grained configurations.


Installing the Kubernetes command line tools on your workstation
Command - kubectl get --all-namespaces services



Inspection

Once kubectl is in our path, we can use it to look at your cluster!

kubectl get --all-namespaces services
should show a set of services that look something like this:

NAMESPACE     NAME          TYPE             CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP       PORT(S)        AGE
default       kubernetes    ClusterIP        10.0.0.1         <none>            443/TCP        1d
kube-system   kube-dns      ClusterIP        10.0.0.2         <none>            53/TCP,53/UDP  1d
kube-system   kube-ui       ClusterIP        10.0.0.3         <none>            80/TCP         1d
...

Similarly, we can take a look at the set of pods that were created during cluster startup.
kubectl get --all-namespaces pods
